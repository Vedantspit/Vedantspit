## About Me :)

I’m a Software Engineer passionate about building backend systems, distributed architectures, and AI-driven applications.  
I love designing scalable services, exploring deep learning, and working on projects that bridge the gap between software engineering and intelligent systems.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 [FynVid – Scalable Video-Streaming Platform](https://github.com/Vedantspit/FynVid)
**Tech:** MongoDB · Redis · ExpressJS · Kafka · JWT · React · Cloudinary

- Built a full-stack video streaming platform with cloud-based uploads, playlists, subscriptions, and nested comment systems.
- Designed an **event-driven backend** using **Apache Kafka** to asynchronously process views, likes, comments, and notifications at scale.
- Implemented **cursor-based pagination** for video feeds to achieve **O(1)** query performance and prevent data-skipping during infinite scroll.
- Secured high-traffic endpoints using **Redis-backed atomic rate limiting** to mitigate login abuse, comment spam, and automated engagement.
- Implemented **stateless JWT authentication** with fine-grained middleware for resource-level access control.
